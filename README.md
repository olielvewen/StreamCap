# StreamCap

StreamCap is a GUI in Python 3 and QT5 for Vobcopy, a command line for grab a Dvd on your Hard Drive. This version is 
just the update of the existing tool written in Python 2.7 and QT4 (called StreamCap).

* PyQt 4
* Qt4
* vobcopy

Installation
------------

For the moment, just open a console in the src folder and type:

```
python streamcap.py
```

* Manjaro

    Python3 is the default version so type :
    ```
    python2 streamcap.py
    ```
    
* Linux Mint/Ubuntu
    
    However, the python default version is the version 2 and not the 3. So you should type :
    
    ```
    python streamcap.py
    ```
