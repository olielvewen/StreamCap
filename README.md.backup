Dependencies
------------

* python 2
* PyQt 4
* Qt4
* vobcopy

Installation
------------

For the moment, just open a console in the streamcap folder and type:

```
python streamcap.py
```

* Manjaro

    Python3 is the default version so type :
    ```
    python2 streamcap.py
    ```
    
* Linux Mint/Ubuntu
    
    However, the python default version is the version 2 and not the 3 until 17.10. After, you should do the same thing than for Manjaro So you should type :
    
    ```
    python streamcap.py
    ```
